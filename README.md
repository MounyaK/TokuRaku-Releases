## What is TokuRaku?
As a Japanese language learner and lover of Japanese culture, I sometimes read novels or manga on my phone
in Japanese. However it can be a very tiresome experience, as kanjis (the japanese alphabet inspired by
Chinese) are numerous and impossible to read if you haven't memorized them (and there are thousands of them!).
Thus, Tokuraku is Japanese reading app with the particularity of using OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
to recognizes kanjis in PDF images and translate them to the reader. The searched kanjis are kept on the PDF
page they were searched on and can be consulted later on. TokuRaku is made for advanced learners who would like
a way to read japanese without having to draw unknown kanjis or search for them in another app while reading.
It can also be a way to learn more kanjis quickly.

## How To Install
For now, TokuRaku isn't on the playstore. You can download the beta version from the release tag.
